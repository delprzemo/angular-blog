 Material Blog is a modern blog template designed for developers. 
The main goal was to create a blog that will be:
<br>
<br>
<ul>
    <li><b>Simple to use</b> - to start using it after 5 mins of introduction <br></li>
    <li><b>Easy to customize</b> - only basic features included. Rest is up to the developer <br></li>
    <li><b>Simple, clean, responsive interface</b> - focus on content, not on extra options <br></li>
    <li><b>Free, open-source</b> - strength is in the community! <br></li>
    <li><b>For IT content</b> - easily highlight code syntax <br></li>
</ul>
<br>


<h2>How to start using it?</h2>
Basically, a blog was written in Angular, but you don't need to know it 
while managing your articles. Before we start adding new articles
<b> we need to install it</b>

<br>
<br>

<ol>
    <li>
        Firstly, install Angular CLI on your machine. Run this command:
        <app-show-code [lang]="" style="color:white">
            npm install -g @angular/cli
        </app-show-code>

        If you don't have NodeJs then you should install it first
        <br><br>

    </li>
    <li>
        Now clone repository
        <app-show-code [lang]="" style="color:white">
            git clone https://github.com/delprzemo/angular-blog.git
        </app-show-code>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        In a path where you've cloned repository install dependencies with a command
        <app-show-code [lang]="'typescript'" style="color:white">
            npm install
        </app-show-code>
        <br>
    </li>
    <li>
        There is the last command for you - it will run your application
        <app-show-code [lang]="'typescript'" style="color:white">
            ng serve
        </app-show-code>

        and that's all! Now you can preview a blog by opening http://localhost:4200
    </li>
</ol>

<br> <br>


<h2>Add new article</h2>
Articles are kept in HTML. If you are not familiar with HTML then you can use some
online editor that will transform content into html.
There are a lot of them. <br>
So, in order to add a new article:
<br><br>

<ol>
    <li>
        Add html file in src/articles/html
    </li>
    <li>
        Go to src/articles/article.service.ts and add article metadata to returned json. 
        For instance, this is json for this article:

        <app-show-code [lang]="" style="color:white">
            return [
            {
            id: 1,
            title: 'Blog created by developer for developers',
            shortText: `Simple, customizable, fast, modern, configurable in json, articles in html -
            finally developers have blog template which is meeting their requirements.
            Time to look into Material Blog`,
            date: new Date(2019, 5, 1),
            html: "easy-blog.html",
            image: '/assets/blog-item.jpg',
            imageUrl: '',
            tags: ['Blog', 'Open source']
            },
            ...
        </app-show-code>

        Again, that's it! Just create html file and fill json data. In cloned repo, there are few example 
        articles (including this one).

        <br><br>

        <b>Tip 1:</b><br> while adding an image to article use 'image' property when you've 
        downloaded image to assets folder or 'imageUrl'
        when you have url to external image <br>
        <b>Tip 2:</b><br> if you want to show code with highlighted syntax then use <b>app-show-code</b> component

<app-show-code [lang]="'typescript'" style="color:white">
‹app-show-code [lang]="'typescript'" style="color:white">
    class MyCode() {
        // example
    }
‹/app-show- code>
</app-show-code>

    </li>
</ol>

<br><br>
<h2>Customize it</h2>
Material Blog is a simple project containing only basic functionalities, so you can customize it according to your
needs, add new functionalities or
even integrate with another website.
<br><br>
Anyway, it would be nice to change something before publishing it - to make your readers distinguish it from other blogs :)
There are few things that you can do:
<br><br>
<ol>
    <li>
        You can replace <b>top-menu-img.jpg</b> in <b>src/assets</b> with another photo
    </li>
    <li>
        Change top menu text in <b>src/app/top-menu.component.html</b>
    </li>
    <li>
        Have fun with styling top-menu (<b>src/app/top-menu.component.less</b>). <br>
        For example change background color:

<app-show-code [lang]="'css'" style="color:white">
.container-fluid {
    background-color: rgba(26, 119, 211, 1);
}
</app-show-code>
        <br>
        or opacity of it:

<app-show-code [lang]="'css'" style="color:white">
.top-img {
    opacity: 0.05;
}
</app-show-code>

        <br>
        Now, it will be slightly different than other blogs :)
    </li>
</ol>


<br><br>
<h2>Make it public</h2>
It's up to you how and where you will deploy your blog. 
Because it is server-less then you need hosting just for static website.
There are a lot of them. Personally, I can recommend <b>netlify.com/</b> where it is extremely easy 
to configure CI/CD for a repository, especially when it is placed in github. 
Now, when I want to add new article it is enough to push it into a repository
and netlify will do rest of job:)
<br><br>
<h3>It is really worth to share your knowledge and experience with a world. 
    Hope, that blog will make it easier and more fun. <b>Enjoy!</b></h3>
